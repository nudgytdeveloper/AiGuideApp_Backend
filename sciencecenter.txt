Exhibitions and Activities 

A Supersized Prehistoric Encounter Awaits at  
Science Centre Singapore
This bold new exhibition at Science Centre explores prehistoric giants and mass extinctions, featuring the awe-inspiring Patagotitan mayorum, a true titan of the dinosaur world. Stand beneath a colossal 40-metre dinosaur cast and feel dwarfed by its prehistoric majesty. This breathtaking encounter awaits at DINOSAURS | EXTINCTIONS | US, debuting at Science Centre Singapore on 11 Oc 2025. Science Centre Singapore and the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum of the National University of Singapore are bringing together two world-renowned exhibitions— Dinosaurs of Patagonia and Six Extinctions — for the first time.   Look forward to an extraordinary journey through 400 million years of Earth’s history, brought to life across 3,000 square metres of exhibition space. With 33 rare fossils and 60 full-scale models, this largest ever dinosaur showcase will unfold across three interactive zones, to reveal the dramatic rise and fall of prehistoric life and the five major mass extinction events that have shaped our planet.

Step into ancient Patagonia, one of the world's most fertile fossil grounds, where 13 extraordinary dinosaur species await guests’ discovery. Curated by Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio (MEF), Dinosaurs of Patagonia features the colossal Patagotitan mayorum, brought to life in a breathtaking full-scale cast that will dominate this prehistoric gathering. Stretching 40 metres and representing dinosaurs that weighed around 70 tonnes, these giants were some of the largest dinosaurs to have walked the Earth. 

Journey through Earth's most catastrophic moments at Gondwana Studios’ Six Extinctions where more than 30 extraordinary displays that chronicle nature's greatest upheavals. Come face-to-face with “Scotty”, the largest Tyrannosaurus rex ever found, before confronting a sobering truth: witnessing the sixth mass extinction unfold in our time. This powerful and thought-provoking finale will challenge guests to grapple with humanity's profound impact on Earth's vanishing biodiversity.

To make the extinction crisis resonate more closely with local audiences, co-organiser Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum has drawn from its own collection to highlight Singapore’s biodiversity challenges. This selection of specimens includes the cream-coloured giant squirrel (Ratufa affinis affinis) and the rufous-collared kingfisher (Actenoides concretus), both now nationally extinct. This section also features cutting-edge scientific methods and analytical tools being employed to study extinction records that will help predict and prevent loss of more species in the future.

Dialogue with Time – Embrace Ageing
Learn about the aging process at our exhibition in Singapore


Dialogue with Time is an interactive exhibition that shows ageing from an original perspective. By 2030, one third of the world's population will be over the age of 65. As this is an important social issue, we aim for individuals to experience and understand more about the ageing process and reconsider their perception of ageing.

Science of Ageing 
Ageing is an ongoing process that eventually causes an irreversible decline in body functions. Through the interactive exhibitions in this zone, individuals will be able to distinguish between natural causes of ageing and causes from external factors. We highlight common misconceptions associated to ageing such as the skin, bones and dementia.

Guided Experience by our Senior Guides
This guided experience is led by passionate retirees aged 60 and above, who will take you through six thoughtfully curated stations. These reflective spaces encourage open conversations about the biological and psychological changes that come with ageing, as well as the societal perceptions surrounding it.

With their lived experiences and wisdom, our senior guides bring each station to life by sharing personal stories, explaining exhibits, and facilitating meaningful discussions that challenge stereotypes and spark inter-generational dialogue.

Come meet our guides and explore ageing through their inspiring lens!

Guided experience sessions via bookings only. 

For MOE, school and corporate groups, please make a booking here.

For all other bookings, please email us at dialogue_with_time@science.edu.sg or call us at 6352 5257.

Alternatively, approach our front desk staff for more information.

My Aging Journey
Join us for a 15 -20 minute session led by our senior guides, as they share personal reflections on their unique journeys through ageing.

Following their stories, you’ll take part in a short activity where you can express what happy ageing means to you. This space invites open sharing and thoughtful reflection, encouraging a deeper understanding of how ageing is shaped by personal experience rather than societal expectations. 

Discover how we can collectively challenge stereotypes and embrace ageing as a meaningful, individual journey.

Earth Alive
Experience Earth Alive, where you can encounter forces and processes that underlie Earth's changes.

Note: The Earthquake Simulator at Earth Alive will be closed until further notice.

The Earth is constantly changing. Some changes are incremental, some are split-second, but both can result in violent events that devastate human communities.

Experience Earth Alive, where you can encounter forces and processes that underlie Earth's changes. Through active, engaging exhibits and compelling visual displays, get a feel for some of Earth’s physical functionings!

The exhibits are organised into spheres that reflect Earth sciences and systems – Geosphere, Hydrosphere and Atmosphere. Each of these spheres looks at how Earth changes can manifest in the environment, causing phenomena such as earthquakes, tsunamis, mountain-building and rock strata, and volcanic eruptions. A fourth section, the Human Sphere, places people into the picture to highlight how Earth changes impact our lives in critical ways and how we can affect the Earth and respond to such changes.

This exhibition was created in partnership with the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS), a Research Centre of Excellence at the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore.

ENERGY STORY
From natural cycles to modern applications, explore the sources, transformation and uses of energy at our latest exhibition!

Energy is all around us. While we might often find it difficult to visualise energy, humankind has learnt how to harness energy for work. Jointly presented by Science Centre Singapore, the Energy Market Authority and SP Group, the Energy Story exhibition captures the story of how humankind has progressed off the back of energy discovery, and must now work towards a cleaner, more sustainable future.

The exhibition features six zones of multimedia displays and interactives where visitors can learn about the sources, transformation and uses of energy, from natural cycles to modern applications.

There are also exhibits featuring Singapore's own energy sector, raising awareness of our four energy switches and how we are working towards a greener energy mix. The exhibition also addresses our responsibility as energy consumers, presenting a vision of a clean and energy-efficient future.

Energy Cycle
Learn about energy cycles in nature by watching this animated feature that uses a special projection effect know as pepper's ghost.

Galilean Cannon
There are many rules governing energy. Some of these produce cool observable effects and even record-breaking feats. Try your hand at the Galilean Cannon to discover how momentum is conserved and see how high you can propel the yellow ball!

Solar Power
Energy can be generated from natural sources, such as the Sun, which gives us solar power. Work with a partner to direct the lamp onto the solar-powered gliders and make them fly!

Liquefied Natural Gas
Fuel sources can be rarely used in their raw form. This interactive follows the transformation of raw natural gas to liquefied natural gas that we use to generate electricity.

Singapore's Energy Story
Discover Singapore's energy strategy for the future through our four switches - natural gas, solar power, regional power grids and low-carbon alternatives.

Power the City of the Future
How will we power cities of the future? Challenge yourself as a single player or compete with friends in a multiplayer mode to see who can emerge a better planner by selecting the right mix of energy sources in this game.
